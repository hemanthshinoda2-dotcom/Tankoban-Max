# Legacy Docs Archive

This folder holds previously active planning/reference markdown files that were
removed from the primary working docs surface during repository restructuring.

Active docs are now intentionally minimal:
1. `CLAUDE.md`
2. `chatgpt.md` (identical copy)
3. `ARCHITECTURE.md` (supporting detail)
4. legal/compliance docs (for example `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`)
